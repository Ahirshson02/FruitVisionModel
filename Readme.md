# Necessary Libraries/Dependencies
Python - version 3.9-3.12 (subversions acceptable)
Tensorflow (I used version 2.19)
Matplotlib (I used version 3.10.1)
Scikit-learn (I used version 1.6.1)

Install Commands:
"pip install tensorflow" OR "pip install tensorflow==2.19"
"pip install matplotlib" OR "pip install matplotlib==3.10.1"
"pip install scikit-learn" OR "pip install scikit-learn==1.6.1"

# Models
All the models included in the written report and presentation are saved as .keras files, and their repsective code can be found in the ml-fruitvision.ipynb file

# Evaluation
For quick and easy evaluation without training, you can run the saved models by running code cells 2 and then cell 1. Cell 2 must run first to initialize the test_dataset
